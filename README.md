# NotromMasterTool
Notrom is the all-in-one automation platform for web developers and small studios. It captures leads, generates proposals, takes payments, provisions projects, launches sites, and runs ongoing Care plans â€” all with minimal manual work. Built on Firebase and Stripe, it turns client work into a predictable, recurring revenue engine.
